        <h4>In June, Austin became ill and was diagnosed with mono. After his condition continued to worsen, he was placed in the hospital
          where further testing enabled them to make a diagnosis of HLH (Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis). HLH is a disorder of the
          immune system in which too many infection-fighting cells are produced and activated, causing damage to organs. Treatment was
          started to get the HLH under control. Austin was then also diagnosed with XLP2 (X-linked lymphoproliferative disease). This is a
          rare disorder of the immune system and blood-forming cells caused by XIAP gene mutations. The only cure for XLP2 and for recurring
          HLH is a bone marrow transplant. The doctors would like him to get this sooner rather than later, as he has already had one recurring
          bout of the HLH. They are currently checking his siblings to see if they are a bone marrow match. If they are not, then the search
          will move to the donor database. At this time, Austin is feeling better and is still attending Tri-Valley as a home-bound student.
          While he is not contagious, this limits his exposure to viruses/infections. He makes weekly visits to Peoria, St Francis Children’s
          Hospital, for treatments and testing, and has also begun visits to Cincinnati Children’s Hospital where the bone marrow transplant will
          take place. This will require a minimum 2 month hospital stay, then 6 months of living within 30 minutes of the Cincinnati hospital –
