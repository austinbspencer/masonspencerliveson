        <h4>Mason Spencer was a fun, loving, unique 13 year old boy. He had a thirst for knowledge and was full of random
          facts. He loved life and was always happy. He enjoyed being with friends, playing basketball, watching TV,
          researching on the Internet and many other things.
        </h4>
        <br>
        <h4> It was summer of 2013. His older brother, Austin(then 16) got very ill and was diagnosed with hemophagocytic
          lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). HLH is a rare life threatening disorder of the immune system. Following this, it was
          discovered Austin had X-linked lymphoproliferative disease from XIAP gene mutation, known as XLP2. Due to this,
          Mason had genetic testing done, and in September 2013 was told he also had XLP2. He was advised this would in
          turn cause him to get HLH in the future, as it did his brother that year, and also a list of other possible
          complications.
        </h4>
        <br>
        <h4> To cure him of all XLP2 complications and prevent HLH from occurring, Mason had a bone marrow transplant in
          May 2014 at Cincinnati Childrens Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC). His sister, Raegan, was the donor. Austin had
          previously had his transplant, also at CCHMC, in January 2014 and was doing as expected.
        </h4>
        <br>
        <h4> In July 2014, the tests showed Mason’s transplant was failing. So Raegan came to Cincinnati and gave blood
          which they separated out just the t-cells. They then gave Mason these t-cells which is known as a donor
          lymphocyte infusion(DLI). Unfortunately on August 1, 2014, Mason began severe signs of graft versus host
          disease(GVHD) as a result of the DLI. He had both skin and gut GVHD. It was said to be stage 4 of 4.</h4>
        <br>
        <h4> Mason battled through this trying every medicine CCHMC could provide him along with photopheresis. He had
          many complications along the way, including kidney damage which caused him to begin dialysis.</h4>
        <br>
        <h4> Mason maintained a positive attitude throughout and he did everything the doctors, nurses and therapists
          asked of him. Unfortunately his body gave out. He had kidney failure, damaged GI tract, damaged liver, an
          infection on his tricuspid valve, brain slowing and respiratory failure. </h4>

        <h4> Mason passed away on August 27, 2015 surrounded by his immediate family. </h4>
