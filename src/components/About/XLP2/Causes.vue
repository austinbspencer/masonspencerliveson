    XLP2 is caused by a change in the XIAP gene. This is sometimes called the
    BIRC4 gene.
    <br />
    <br />
    The XIAP gene codes for the XIAP protein that the body needs to regulate the
    immune system. People with this genetic change either have problems with the
    XIAP protein, or they do not have the protein. Another name for this
    condition is XIAP deficiency. This is a unique disorder. The term we use is
    “XIAP deficiency.”
    <br />
    <br />
    XIAP deficiency is an “X-linked” disease. This means that the genes that
    cause it are on the X chromosome. Boys have one X chromosome and one Y
    chromosome. Girls have two X chromosomes. If a boy has a changed XIAP gene
    on his X chromosome, he will develop XIAP deficiency.
    <br />
    <br />
    For a girl to develop XIAP deficiency, she would need to have genetic
    changes on both X chromosomes. Another way she could develop XIAP deficiency
    would be by a “skewing” of X-chromosome inactivation. This causes many cells
    to be deficient in XIAP. Most girls with a genetic change are just carriers.
    They do not develop symptoms of XIAP / XLP2.
    <br />
    <br />
    Girls that are affected by XIAP deficiency most commonly develop
    inflammatory bowel disease. But they can also develop other problems caused
    by XIAP deficiency. Girls who are affected or who are carriers can pass the
    disease on to their sons. The chance of this happening is 50%. They can also
    pass carrier status or, more rarely, the disease to their daughters.
