    Between 67% and 90% of children with XIAP develop hemophagocytic
    lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). This is a potentially life-threatening disorder
    of the immune system that causes organ damage.

    Some children with XIAP deficiency develop some symptoms of HLH. These
    include fever, low blood counts and enlarged spleens. But they do not have
    the “full picture” of HLH. This is considered “incomplete HLH.”
