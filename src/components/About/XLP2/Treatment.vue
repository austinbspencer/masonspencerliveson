    Currently, the only cure for XIAP deficiency is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. This is sometimes called a bone marrow transplant. These transplants replace diseased blood-forming stem cells with healthy ones. Not all patients with XIAP deficiency need a transplant.

    If your child has XIAP deficiency, ongoing care from an experienced team of specialists is very important. The care team can provide an accurate diagnosis and comprehensive treatment plan to help your child have the best outcome possible. If needed, the care team can include specialists from many areas of medicine, such as a pediatric gastroenterologist.

    Treatment for children with XIAP deficiency may include:
    <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Steroids plus other immunosuppressant medicines or chemotherapy to help regulate the immune system</li>
      <li>Biologic medicines to treat low antibody levels</li>
      <li>Immunosuppressant medicines and diet changes for symptoms of inflammatory bowel syndrome</li>
      <li>Antibiotics or antiviral medicines for children who develop repeated infections</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    Some children with XIAP deficiency should not have live virus vaccines because of their abnormal immune system. These vaccines include chickenpox/varicella; rotavirus; and measles, mumps and rubella (MMR).
