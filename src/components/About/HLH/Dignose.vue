    HLH can only be diagnosed with proper blood tests in the appropriate
    clinical setting.. Doctors might collect some fluid from the spinal canal to
    look for HLH in the brain. It is important to remember certain malignancies
    (including leukemia and lymphoma) can mimic HLH, therefore these conditions
    should be appropriately investigated during the work-up of a suspected
    patient with HLH.

    Other tests that might be performed include:
    <br />

    <ul>
      <li>X-rays</li>
      <li>Bone marrow testing</li>
      <li>CT scans</li>
      <li>Ultrasounds</li>
      <li>PET scan (to look for malignancy)</li>
      <li>MRIs</li>
      <li>Tests to look for infections that can be associated with HLH</li>
      <li>
        Special blood tests that can be done to quickly screen patients for the
        genetic causes of HLH
