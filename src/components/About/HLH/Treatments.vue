    Prompt treatment is very important for patients with HLH, as the condition is often fatal. The first treatments are typically used to stop the inflammation in the body. These treatments suppress the immune system which helps decrease the damage to a patientâ€™s body.

    <br>
    Treatment may include:
    <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Steroids plus chemotherapy</li>
      <li>Antibody therapy to destroy certain immune cells</li>
      <li>Medicines that suppress the immune system</li>
      <li>Medicines to help treat any infections that are present and to prevent new infections </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    With treatment, HLH may come under control after a few weeks. However, it may flare again later, especially as treatment is decreased and a patient may need further treatment.

    Often, patients with primary HLH may need a <a href="https://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/service/b/bone-marrow">bone marrow transplant</a> (BMT). Often patients who have a successful BMT go on to lead full, productive lives.
