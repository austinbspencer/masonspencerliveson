    HLH is a rare disease, and healthcare providers are still learning about its causes. There are 2
    types of HLH: familial and acquired. Familial HLH accounts for about 25% of cases and families
    pass down the condition. If both parents are genetic carriers of HLH, a child has a 25% chance
    of having the disease, a 25% chance of not having the disease, and a 50% chance of being a
    carrier. A number of conditions cause acquired HLH. These include:
    <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li> Viral infections, especially Epstein-Barr virus</li>
      <li>Other infections</li>
      <li>A weak or diseased immune system</li>
      <li>Cancer</li>
    </ul>
