    Your healthcare provider bases a diagnosis of HLH on your symptoms, physical exam findings, and several lab tests. A prolonged fever is a commonly occurring symptom. An enlarged liver or spleen (located in the upper left side of the abdomen) are key physical findings. Your healthcare provider conducts blood tests to look for:
    <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Low levels of white blood cells called natural killer cells (these cells are important for a healthy immune system)</li>
      <li>Low levels of white blood cells, red blood cells, and clotting cells called platelets</li>
      <li>High levels of triglycerides (fats in your blood)</li>
      <li>Low levels of fibrinogen (a protein important for clotting)</li>
      <li>High levels of ferritin (a protein that stores iron)</li>
      <li>High levels of a substance called CD25 which increases in your blood when your immune system is stimulated</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    Another important test, a bone marrow biopsy, calls for taking a sample of your bone marrow (the center of the bone, where blood cells are made) and examining it under a microscope. Other tests may include genetic testing and blood cultures, which are blood samples, to look for infection in your blood.
