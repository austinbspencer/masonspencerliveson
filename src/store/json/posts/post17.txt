Last week we attended Tri-valley Academic Awards ceremony to announce this years winner of the Mason Spencer Award. Colt Baker will receive $500 towards his tuition at Illinois State University where he will major in business.  Congratulations Colt! 
Attached is a video describing the award and the winner, a picture with Colt, and also a picture of the perpetual plaque that will hang at the school.
