On the last day of school, Bart attended the final assembly for Tri Valley Middle School. (Tamara was in Cincinnati w Austin at appts.) At this assembly, the Mason Spencer Award, which is a plaque and $75 to Dicks Sporting Goods, was presented to this years winner. Mason loved to get gift cards so we feel this is a fitting gift. 
The winner is chosen by the coaches and has to be an 8th grade basketball player. Mason loved basketball and 8th grade was the last year he was able to play. This years winner was chosen based on qualities like Mason such as terrific work ethic, put team goals first before his own, and is a great kid both on and off the court. 
This years winner was Logan Petrilli.   Congratulations Logan!! https://www.facebook.com/418764678333644/videos/780925305623725
