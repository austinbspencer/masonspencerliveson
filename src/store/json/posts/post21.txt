We are excited to announce the Mason Spencer Lives On Foundation donation of $8,000 to Cincinnati Childrens Medical Hospital. The money is targeted to go to the following two research efforts which we picked from a list of ongoing projects.
- Continuation on the pilot study to treat XIAP patients with quercetin to see if IL-18 levels and other inflammatory markers go down. (Dr. Marsh has a friend in London, England also working to open this there.)
- A larger treatment study of Precision Dosing for alemtuzumab so that levels are just right at the time of transplant to prevent GVHD and mixed chimerism.
