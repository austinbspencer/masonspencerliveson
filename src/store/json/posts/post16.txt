This week Bart attended the final assembly at the Tri Valley Middle School. (Tamara was out of town.) At this assembly, the Mason Spencer Award, which is a plaque and $75 to Dicks Sporting Goods, was presented to this years winner. Mason loved to get gift cards so we felt this was a fitting gift. 
The winner is chosen by the coaches and has to be an 8th grade basketball player. Mason loved basketball and 8th grade was the last year he was able to play. This winner is chosen based on qualities like Mason such as great work ethic, listens to coaches, never argues or complains, and puts the team first. 
This years winner was Zac Creamean.   Congratulations Zac!!
