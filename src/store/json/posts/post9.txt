Each year Mason Spencer Lives On Foundation presents a $500 scholarship to a Tri Valley senior that has the most “Mason characteristics”. We would like to announce this years winner....Drew Kitterman.
Drew will be attending Colorado State University where he plans to major in Business.
Congratulations Drew!
Unfortunately the award ceremony was online this year so we were not able to congratulate Drew in person. Mason's scholarship announcement is around the 28:45 mark.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gyGoEbPYtU&feature=youtu.be
