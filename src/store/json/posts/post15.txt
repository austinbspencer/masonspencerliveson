Each year we give a $500 scholarship to a Tri Valley senior that has the most “Mason characteristics”.  This year it’s Mason’s graduating class so it was a hard year for the committee to pick a winner. Due to this fact we added an “award” to each nominee. It has a saying he had written in 6th grade on a pillow case they made and has his actual signature. Thanks to By the Lake Designs in Downs for creating this for us. 
Now the important part of this.....we would again like to congratulate this years winner....Clayton Leipold. Clayton will be attending Cornell College and playing basketball.
