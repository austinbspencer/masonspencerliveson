A donation has been made! 
Thanks to all our supporters throughout the past year and those participating in our fundraiser last year! Because of you, we were able to send $6000 to Cincinnati Childrens Medical Center this year. When we donate to CCHMC, they allow us to select where the money goes. We discuss with BMT doctors the different options and pick one or two that we feel would have benefited Mason. This year the money will be directed to two specific research efforts. Dr. Khandelwal's work targeting prevention of GI GVHD (gasteravintestinal graft vs host disease) and Dr. Marshâ€™s XIAP work on targeted treatments. Mason had XIAP and he developed GI GVHD after his transplant so we are hopeful that this research will help those affected in the future.
