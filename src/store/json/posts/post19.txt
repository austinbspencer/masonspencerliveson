This weekend I attended a fundraiser for HLH. It was a trivia night in St Louis put on by the Matthew and Andrew Akin Foundation. For one round, the questions were about survivor and angel children that have previously been ridden for in the 700 mile ride. Some were easy answers like Mason's. Other were not as simple.

Please remember someone needs blood every two seconds and there are 14,000 patients waiting on a donor to appear in the marrow database. So go give blood every 56 days and join be the match!
